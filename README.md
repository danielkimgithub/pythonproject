pandas is an open-source library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools for Python. In this intermediate-level, hands-on course, learn how to use the pandas library and tools for data analysis and data structuring. Instructor Jonathan Fernandes dives into topics such as DataFrames, basic plotting, indexing, and groupby. To help you learn how to work with data more effectively, Jonathan takes you through a series of exercises that are based on the same large, public data set: the Olympic medal winners from 1896 to 2008.
